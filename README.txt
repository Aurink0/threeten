ThreeTen
========
ThreeTen provides a modern date and time library for Java.
It is the reference implementation for JSR-310.

This GitHub project is currently dormant, as active development
has moved to OpenJDK:

Project: http://openjdk.java.net/projects/threeten/
   Code: http://hg.openjdk.java.net/threeten/threeten/jdk
Javadoc: http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~rriggs/threeten-javadoc/index.html

The active issue tracker is located here at GitHub:
https://github.com/ThreeTen/threeten/issues

The project was originally housed at Sourceforge.
The original home page and early downloads are available there:
http://threeten.sourceforge.net/
http://sourceforge.net/projects/threeten/

It is intended that the GitHub sourcebase will be used for a
backport of JSR-310-like functionality to JDK7. However, to avoid
confusion, this may occur in a separate GitHub repo.
