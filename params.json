{"body":"### ThreeTen\r\nThe ThreeTen project provides a modern date and time library for Java and is the reference implementation for JSR-310.\r\n\r\n### Status - October 2012\r\nWork continues to streamline the API for potential inclusion in JDK 8. Some aspects of this work are now reasonably complete, whereas others (such as non-ISO calendar systems) require more work.\r\n\r\nThe [Javadoc](http://threeten.sourceforge.net/apidocs-2012-10-25/index.html) of the latest code is available (2012-10-25).\r\n\r\nThe ThreeTen project is still considered to be in Alpha. Methods may appear and disappear at any point.\r\n\r\nSource code is hosted at GitHub. Pull requests will be considered!\r\n\r\nSee the [official home page](https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/threeten/index.php?title=ThreeTen).\r\n","google":"","tagline":"The reference implementation for JSR-310","note":"Don't delete this file!
