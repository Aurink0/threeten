## Former home of the ThreeTen/JSR-310 project

JSR-310 is a project under the Java Community Process to provide
a modern date and time library for the JDK. ThreeTen is the name
of the Reference Implementation used to develop the specification.

This GitHub project is currently dormant, as active development
of JSR-310 has moved to [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/threeten/)
following integration with JDK1.8.
